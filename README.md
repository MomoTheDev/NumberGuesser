# NumberGuesser
A simple number guesser game, in Java!

---
It's just a simple number guessing game, you can run the file using the command below:

```cmd
#...> Java -jar ./NumberGuesser-1.0.0.jar
```
The default origin/bound is 0/1000, you can change them by adding two arguments to the command (or just one argument to set the bound).

You can type `exit` to exit the game


# Updating
I have enough time to manage this project by my own, you can suggest me some features you'd like or maybe report some bugs as well.
You can give suggestions and report bugs to me via Discord (MomoTheSiM#6478).
